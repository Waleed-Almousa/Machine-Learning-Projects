# Statistics 451:Introduction to Machine Learning and Statistical Pattern Classification
This repository contains the Coding assignments I completed in my stats 451 course in the fall of 2023

For each assignment, I was given a set of questions related to the current learning material of the course, and I answered the questions using python code. 

Topics covered in this course include but are not limitited to:

- Supervised Learning
  - Support vector machines
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Kernel Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - K-NN Regression and Classification

- Unsupervised Learning
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Outlier Detection
- Ensemble Learning
  -  Bagging
  -  Gradient Boosting
- Basic Practices:
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn
  - Feature engineering
  - Cross Validation
  - Train/Test/Split
  - Assessing Model Performance
